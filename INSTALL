Building from command line
==========================
1. Create shadow build directory.

2. Go into shadow build directory.

3. Ensure the correct DESTDIR is set in .pro file. This is the directory to which you want to install. For example, "/usr" or "/usr/local".

4. Run lrelease ../QMentat/QMentat.pro to generate .qm translation files.

5. Run (assuming path to project is ../QMentat/):
qmake ../QMentat/QMentat.pro -r -spec linux-g++ CONFIG+=release

6. Run make

7. Run make install

Building Debian package
=======================
NOTE: Debian packaging files are removed, so these will not work at the moment. I am working
on the packaging, but I'm thinking they shouldn't be right in the actual upstream release.

1. Make a directory for the build. I will use 'pkg' as the directory.

2. Copy QMentat main directory into the pkg directory, in this format:

qmentat-version

For example, version 0.8 would be:

qmentat-0.8

3. Edit DESTDIR in QMentat.pro to set the installation prefix. This should be /usr in most cases. The DESTDIR line should read:

DESTDIR = /usr

4. Run lrelease QMentat.pro

5. Run package.sh

In the root of the pkg directory, you will see all the package files. Most importantly, the .deb package file. That is assuming everything worked.
