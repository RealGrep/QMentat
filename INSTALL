Building from command line
==========================
1. Create shadow build directory.

2. Go into shadow build directory.

3. Ensure the correct DESTDIR is set in .pro file. This is the directory to which you want to install.

4. Run (assuming path to project is ../QMentat/):
qmake ../QMentat/QMentat.pro -r -spec linux-g++ CONFIG+=release

5. Run make

6. Run lrelease ../QMentat/QMentat.pro to generate .qm translation files.

6. Run make install

Building Debian package
=======================
1. Make a directory for the build. I will use 'pkg' as the directory.

2. Copy QMentat main directory into the pkg directory, in this format:

qmentat-version

For example, version 0.8 would be:

qmentat-0.8

3. Edit DESTDIR in QMentat.pro to set the installation prefix. This should be /usr in most cases. The DESTDIR line should read:

DESTDIR = /usr

4. Run package.sh

In the root of the pkg directory, you will see all the package files. Most importantly, the .deb package file. That is assuming everything worked.
