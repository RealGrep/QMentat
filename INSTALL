Building from command line
==========================
1. You will need, other than g++ and associated tools: the Qt4 development tools, libraries and headers, as well as the libraries and headers for Boost and GMP.

2. Create shadow build directory. For example, a good name is QMentat-build.

3. Go into shadow build directory.

4. Ensure the correct PREFIX is set in .pro file. This is the directory to which you want to install. For example, "/usr" or "/usr/local".

5. Run (assuming path to project is ../QMentat/):
qmake ../QMentat/QMentat.pro -r -spec linux-g++ CONFIG+=release

6. Run make

7. Run sudo make install
