It uses arbitrary length fixed point arithmetic and can handle any size numbers, only limited by the size of your screen (and in the case of division with an integer result, the speed at which the number can be factored). It is also quite configurable, allowing you to tailor the questions to your needs.\r\n\r\nMichel Dusseault <mike.dusseault@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
