<h1>QMentat Manual</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to QMentat, a versatile program to help you practice mental
arithmetic.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>The Main Interface</h2>

<p>When you first start up QMentat, it will be showing the
<a href="#Addition">Addition Module</a>. However, all modules function in a
similar manner. Modules may be selected by either clicking on the appropriate
icon in the toolbar, or selecting it from the "Practice" menu.</p>

<p>In the application's window, you will see the question
display area at the top. This is where the currently active question will
be shown.</p>

<p>Immediately below the question display is where you will type in your
answer for the current question.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the application window is the area used by the
application to communicate with you. Mostly, it will show a message telling
you if you answered the last question correctly or not.</p>

<p>Right above the question display, you will see two tabs labelled "Main" and
"Settings". The main tab is the one that contains the question display and is
basically where you do your practicing. The "Settings" tab allows you to set
the parameters for the questions. For example, you may set the range of a
number used in the question, such as adding a number from 0 to 1000 to another
number from 0 to 100.</p>

<a name="Addition">
<h2>Addition</h2>

<p>The Addition Module allows you to practice adding numbers. The numbers may be
positive, negative, and contain digits after the decimal point.</p>
