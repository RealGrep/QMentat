<h1>QMentat Manual</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to QMentat, a versatile program to help you practice mental
arithmetic. Whether you simply wish to brush up on your multiplication
tables, or you want to practice dividing very large numbers, this
program can help you.</p>

<p>When I started learning just how easy doing math in my head, I
looked for a good program to help me practice. The exercises in the
books just weren't enough. Any programs I found didn't seem flexible
enough for me. I wanted a program in which I could generate problems
according to very specific rules. And so QMentat was born.</p>

<p>I hope you will find it as fun as I do. And if you're just getting
started with mental arithmetic, I suggest you start with something like
addition, which can be learned quite quickly. Once you're learned to
add from left to right, you'll see how easy it makes adding numbers
together. And that's a simple skill that can come in very handy for a
great many people.</p>

<p>One good source of techniques is Wikipedia's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_calculation">Mental Calculation</a> page.</p>

<!-- Reference that good book -->

<!-- This needs a pep talk of some sort -->

<h2>The Main Interface</h2>

<p>When you first start up QMentat, it will be showing the
<a href="#Addition">Addition Module</a>. However, all modules function in a
similar manner. Modules may be selected by either clicking on the appropriate
icon in the toolbar, or selecting them from the "Practice" menu.</p>

<p>In the application's window, you will see the question
display area at the top. This is where the currently active question will
be shown.</p>

<p>Immediately below the question display is where you will type in your
answer for the current question.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the application window is the area used by the
application to communicate with you. Mostly, it will show a message telling
you if you answered the last question correctly or not.</p>

<p>Right above the question display, you will see two tabs labelled "Main" and
"Settings". The main tab is the one that contains the question display and is
basically where you do your practicing. The "Settings" tab allows you to set
the parameters for the questions. For example, you may set the range of a
number used in the question, such as adding a number from 0 to 1000 to another
number from 0 to 100.</p>

<a name="Addition"></a>
<h2>Addition</h2>

<p>The Addition Module allows you to practice adding together two numbers. The
numbers may be positive, negative, and contain digits after the decimal point.</p>

<h3>Addition Technique</h3>

<p>The main principle for mental addition, and many other techniques in mental calculation, is to go left to right. Let me show you an example:</p>

<p>54 + 25 = ?</p>

<p>First you add the tens, then the ones. In your head, or out loud, say "50 plus 20 is 70. 70 plus 4 is 74. 74 plus 5 is 79."</p>

<p>This same technique works quite well with much larger numbers with more digits, with some practice. And the beauty of it is, you don't have to worry about remembering carries during the addition, which would make it much harder to do in your head.</p>

<p>For example, doing 93 + 48 = ?. Let's do the same process on it as before. We say: "90 plus 40 is 130. 130 plus three is 133. 133 plus 8 is 141, which is the answer."</p>

<p>See how simple it really is? When I first learned it, I really had to wonder why we don't teach at least a few of these techniques to children in school. They're so simple, I feel somewhat cheated to not have learned to do this in class as a child.</p>

<h3>Addition Settings</h3>

<p>In the settings tab, there are a few parameters you may adjust to suit
your practice goals. Keep in mind that very large numbers may be limited by
such factors as the width of your screen and the size of the font you are using.
</p>

<p>Mainly, you will be interested in setting the range of both the first and
the second number to be added. Each number may have it's range specified
separately, and contain different numbers of digits after the decimal point.
The answer is expected to contain as many digits after the decimal point as
the most used by the random numbers generated for the first and second numbers.
However, it is not necessary to add trailing zeroes after the decimal point.
</p>

<p>How many digits each number will have after the decimal point is determined
by the most provided by the minimum and maximum numbers for that number.</p>

<p>In more detail, here are the fields present in the settings for the addition
module:</p>

<h4>First Number</h4>

<h5>Minimum</h5>

<p>The smallest allowed value for the first number in the addition. It must
be smaller than (or equal to) the maximum number provided.</p>

<p>This can be negative, and include any number of decimal places. The generated
number will have as many digits after the decimal point as the most supplied
between the minimum and maximum values.</p>

<p>The answer will contain as many digits after the decimal place as the most
used by the first and second numbers.</p>

<h5>Maximum</h5>

<p>The largest allowed value for the first number in the addition. It must be
larger than (or equal to) the minimum number provided.</p>

<p>This can be negative, and include any number of decimal places. The
generated number will have as many digits after the decimal point as the most
supplied between the minimum and maximum values.</p>

<p>The answer will contain as many digits after the decimal place as the
most used by the first and second numbers.</p>

<h4>Second Number</h4>

<h5>Minimum</h5>

<p>The smallest allowed value for the second number in the addition. It must
be smaller than (or equal to) the maximum number provided.</p>

<p>This can be negative, and include any number of decimal places. The
generated number will have as many digits after the decimal point as
the most supplied between the minimum and maximum values.</p>

<p>The answer will contain as many digits after the decimal place as
the most used by the first and second numbers.</p>

<h5>Maximum</h5>

<p>The largest allowed value for the second number in the addition. It must
be larger than (or equal to) the minimum number provided.</p>

most supplied between the minimum and maximum values.</p>

<p>The answer will contain as many digits after the decimal place as the
most used by the first and second numbers.</p>

largest number as the first number, and the smallest one as the second
number. Otherwise, what ever is generated will be used without modification.</p>
